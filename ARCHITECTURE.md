# Agent Conductor — Architecture

## Problem

AGENTS.md and SKILL.md are the two conventions the coding-agent ecosystem has
converged on, but both are passive: agents read them as prose and comply (or
don't) on the honor system. Nothing compiles the contract, nothing gates the
decision, nothing verifies the checklist ran. Conductor makes the conventions
executable without asking any agent tool to change — it ships as a standard
MCP server.

## Components

### Contract parser (`src/contract/`)

Compiles AGENTS.md into an `AgentContract`. Convention-based, not
schema-based: it walks the markdown heading tree and extracts the recurring
patterns of the AGENTS.md ecosystem —

- **mission** (`Mission` / `Purpose` / `Overview` heading)
- **rules** (prioritized: `Non-negotiables` > `Engineering rules` > generic
  `rules` — priority order matters because a generic "Product rules" section
  must not shadow an explicit non-negotiables list)
- **layers** (first table with a `Layer` column under an architecture heading)
- **gates** (shell code blocks under checklist/verification headings —
  the commands that must pass before handoff)
- **skills** (recommendation tables with `Task`/`Skill`/`Why` columns,
  links resolved)
- **out of scope** (list under an out-of-scope/non-goals heading)
- **spend mandate** (optional table under spend-cap / cost-ceiling headings,
  plus high-impact tool lists)

Unrecognized sections are preserved verbatim in `sections`, so the compiled
form is lossless. Zero dependencies — a small line-walker that is
fence-aware (headings inside code blocks don't split sections).

### Bounded runs (`src/budget/`)

In-process spend control that extends CHP rather than replacing it:

- **preflight** — approximate token/cost breakdown (`ceil(chars/4)`,
  documented class rates aligned with CHP `ModelTier`)
- **authorize / commit** — reserve then settle; missing clearance
  fail-closes; ledger `before` / `after` (and `route` for model choice)
- **ceilings** — per-run, per-tool, per-tenant UTC-day; `maxTurns` is
  the stuck-loop cap
- **high-impact tools** — `APPROVE_REQUIRED` until `run_approve`, which
  calls existing `r0_gate` (optional `funded` criterion composed in
  `bridge.py`, not in vendored `gates.py`)
- **kill switch** — process-local; the model is not consulted

The ledger is in-memory for the MCP process lifetime. The controller
does not execute the model or tool — the client does, only after PASS.

### Skill loader + registry (`src/skills/`)

Implements progressive disclosure over the SKILL.md convention:

- **Discovery** scans, in shadowing order: `.conductor/skills`,
  `.claude/skills`, `.cursor/skills` (project), then `~/.claude/skills`,
  `~/.cursor/skills` (personal). First hit per skill name wins.
- **Metadata** comes from frontmatter only (name, description, version,
  tools) — what `skills_list` returns, cheap enough to put wholesale in a
  model's context.
- **Bodies** load on demand via `skill_load`.

The registry surface (register / get / summary) is adapted from
onchainmind's `SkillRegistry`, re-pointed from compiled-in TypeScript skill
classes to filesystem-discovered SKILL.md files.

### Decision engine (`engine/`)

Published [`consensus-hardening-protocol`](https://pypi.org/project/consensus-hardening-protocol/)
(`import chp`), reached through `bridge.py` over newline-delimited JSON
(`{id, method, params}` → `{id, result | error}`). MCP tools map 1:1:

| MCP tool | Bridge method | CHP surface |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `decision_gate` | `r0_gate` | `chp.gates.evaluate_r0_gate` |
| `decision_adversary` | `adversary` | `TriangulationRunner.as_adversary` |
| `engine_status` | `ping` | package version + subprocess health |
| *(v0.3)* `decision_lock` / mesh sessions | TBD | lock progression + multi-agent |

- **`r0_gate`** — the cheapest, highest-leverage CHP gate: before any work,
  is the decision solvable, scoped, valid, and worth making? Any FATAL →
  HALT. Optional `funded` adds a spend-mandate row in `bridge.py`.
- **`adversary`** — `TriangulationRunner.as_adversary(claim)`: a one-shot
  pass where CHP attacks the claim's foundations, produces a 0–100
  foundation score, devil's-advocate findings, and a session status
  (EXPLORING / HALT / REFRAME_REQUIRED).

Install with `pip install -r engine/requirements.txt` (Python 3.10+).
Do not re-vendor; protocol fixes belong in the upstream package.

### Bridge client (`src/engine/chpBridge.ts`)

Lazily spawns `python3 engine/bridge.py`, correlates requests/responses by
id, rejects all pending calls if the child dies, and logs engine stderr to
the server's stderr. The subprocess is reused across calls.

## Design decisions

1. **MCP as the delivery surface.** The product must work with agent tools
   as they exist. MCP is the one integration point they all share.
2. **Two languages, one process tree.** The governance assets are Python,
   the MCP/skill ecosystem is TypeScript. Rewriting either side would burn
   the leverage of reusing proven code; a subprocess JSON bridge costs ~50
   lines per side and zero network dependencies.
3. **Zero runtime dependencies beyond the MCP SDK.** Markdown and
   frontmatter parsing are hand-rolled subsets — the formats in the wild
   are regular enough, and the parsers are fully covered by tests. This
   honors the "minimal dependencies" rule that AGENTS.md files themselves
   tend to declare.
4. **stdout discipline.** stdout belongs to the MCP transport; every log
   line goes to stderr (`src/utils/logger.ts`). Same rule inside the
   Python engine: responses only on stdout.
5. **Lossless compilation.** The parser extracts what it recognizes and
   preserves the rest, so a contract round-trips even when a project's
   AGENTS.md uses headings we've never seen.

## Testing

- `npm test` — node:test, runs the TypeScript directly (Node 23+ type
  stripping; `erasableSyntaxOnly` keeps the source strippable): contract
  parser against the real fixture and edge cases, skill loader/registry,
  and the live engine bridge end to end (spawns Python).
- `npm run test:engine` — Python-side protocol tests: happy paths, unknown
  method, missing params.
